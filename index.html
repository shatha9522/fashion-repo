    <h3>Summer colors</h3>
    <p> Although at first glance the Summer palette appears to consist largely of blues and pinks, there's such a huge range of those colors that they might as well be totally different - pastel pink through to the softest plum; powder blue through to deepest indigo.  

        There are also less obvious hues: pastel primrose, a deep sensuous green, bright jade, cocoa brown and gorgeous purples.
        
        What unifies the palette, is a Cool blue undertone with a slight grey tint giving a smokey softness.
        
        Pinks are rose or mauve tinted, greens are straight from the sea; nothing that leans towards golden tones. The token pale primrose could hardly be considered yellow at all!
